*narrow* is a Vim plugin to emulate Emacs' narrowing feature.
From GNU Emacs Manual:

	Narrowing means focusing in on some portion of the buffer, making the
	rest temporarily inaccessible. The portion which you can still get to
	is called the accessible portion. Canceling the narrowing, which makes
	the entire buffer once again accessible, is called widening. The
	bounds of narrowing in effect in a buffer are called the buffer's
	restriction.

	Narrowing can make it easier to concentrate on a single subroutine or
	paragraph by eliminating clutter. It can also be used to limit the
	range of operation of a replace command or repeating keyboard macro.

Note that there are some differences from the original behavior.
See |narrow-bugs| for the detail.
