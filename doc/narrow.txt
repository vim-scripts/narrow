==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION					*narrow-introduction*

Narrow is a Vim plugin to emulate Emacs' narrowing feature.
From GNU Emacs Manual:

	Narrowing means focusing in on some portion of the buffer, making the
	rest temporarily inaccessible. The portion which you can still get to
	is called the accessible portion. Canceling the narrowing, which makes
	the entire buffer once again accessible, is called widening. The
	bounds of narrowing in effect in a buffer are called the buffer's
	restriction.

	Narrowing can make it easier to concentrate on a single subroutine or
	paragraph by eliminating clutter. It can also be used to limit the
	range of operation of a replace command or repeating keyboard macro.

Note that there are some differences from the original behavior.
See |narrow-bugs| for the detail.




==============================================================================
INTERFACES					*narrow-interfaces*

						*:Narrow*
:[range]Narrow
	Narrow down to [range].  The default [range] is the current line.
	If the buffer is already narrowed, nothing will happen.

						*:Widen*
:Widen
	Widen to make the entire buffer visible again.
	If the buffer is not narrowed, nothing will happen.

						*narrow#Narrow()*
narrow#Narrow({line1}, {line2})
	Function version of |:Narrow|.
	Narrow down to between {line1} and {line2}.
	Return true on success or false on failure.

						*narrow#Widen()*
narrow#Widen()
	Function version of |:Widen|.
	Return true on success or false on failure.

						*b:narrow_original_state*
b:narrow_original_state
	The variable to save the state of the buffer before narrowing.
	This variable doesn't exist when the buffer is not narrowed.




==============================================================================
BUGS						*narrow-bugs*

- Narrowing is based on Vim's |folding| feature.  So you can
  * See hidden portions as folds.
  * Show a hidden portion by |zR| or other commands.
  * Move the cursor into a hidden portion.
  * Modify the content of a hidden portion by |:s| or other commands.
  In Emacs, these actions aren't allowed.

- This plugin uses |:mkview| to save the current state of a buffer for
  |:Widen|, and and |:mkview| writes a file.  So this plugin may be confused
  when there are two or more Vim processes and they narrow/widen the same
  buffers.

- Temporary files written by |:mkview| will be created in the "narrow"
  subdirectory in 'viewdir'.  For example, "~/.vim/view/narrow".
